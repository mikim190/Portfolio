                I'm highly passionate about writing code following good
                practices and top-notch technologies. I have been involved in
                many technological projects, in the field of business,
                government and startup, always working on both the back-end and
                the front-end. On the academic side I hold a Bachelor of
                Engineering in Environmental. I consider myself a person with
                hunger for knowledge and always looking for new ideas to improve
                what the market has to offer.

                I love to solve problems. Whether itâ€™s finding the most elegant
                way to write a line of code or figuring out which technologies
                fit best into the project, I love the challenge of finding a way
                and discovering solutions.

                I primarily use React and JavaScript, but picking up new
                framework or language isn't a problem. I have programming
                experience and I'm comfortable developing on the frontend as
                well as backend.
